# Japanese-haiku-kigo-corpus
A corpus of Japanese kigo (words or phrases that are associated with a particular season in haiku) with pronunciation and corresponding season.
This corpus is entirely in Japanese.

### What are _kigo_ (季語)?
Traditional Japanese haiku, a type of short form poetry that follows the of 5-7-5 syllable rule, generally contain a seasonal reference that makes it clear to the reader whether the poem takes place in spring, summer, autumn or winter. This seasonal reference is called _kigo_ (季語). 

A list of _kigo_ with their corresponding season was scraped from ["Ouchi de Haiku Kurabu"](https://ouchidehaiku.com/spring/contents/seasonwords), a website for haiku lovers that collects thousands of _kigo_ for inspiration. 

In this repository you can find the [scraping code](https://github.com/annatramarin/Japanese-haiku-kigo-corpus/blob/main/scraping_code.ipynb) used to obtain the corpus, together with the subcorpora divided by season ([spring](https://github.com/annatramarin/Japanese-haiku-kigo-corpus/blob/main/spring_kigo_dataset.csv), [summer](https://github.com/annatramarin/Japanese-haiku-kigo-corpus/blob/main/summer_kigo_dataset.csv), [autumn](https://github.com/annatramarin/Japanese-haiku-kigo-corpus/blob/main/autumn_kigo_dataset.csv), [winter](https://github.com/annatramarin/Japanese-haiku-kigo-corpus/blob/main/winter_kigo_dataset.csv) and [New Year](https://github.com/annatramarin/Japanese-haiku-kigo-corpus/blob/main/new_year_kigo_dataset.csv). You can also find all the subcorpora merged together in a [full kigo corpus](https://github.com/annatramarin/Japanese-haiku-kigo-corpus/blob/main/full_kigo_dataset.csv) for convenience.
