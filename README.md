This corpus is entirely in Japanese.

### What are _kigo_ (季語)?
Traditional Japanese haiku, a type of short form poetry that follows the of 5-7-5 syllable rule, generally contain a seasonal reference that makes it clear to the reader whether the poem takes place in spring, summer, autumn or winter. This seasonal reference is called _kigo_ (季語). 

A list of _kigo_ with their corresponding season was scraped from [Ouchi de Haiku Kurabu] (https://ouchidehaiku.com/spring/contents/seasonwords), a website for haiku lovers that collects thousands of _kigo_ for inspiration.
